<p>Audio description provides content to people who are blind and others who cannot see the video adequately. <s>It is also used by people who process text better than visual information such as graphs.</s></p>
<p>Audio description describes visual information needed to understand the content. It is usually narration added to the soundtrack. Alternatively, it can be provided as a text track that can be read by screen reader software.</p>
<p>For some types of video (such as some training videos), audio description  can be seamlessly integrated into the  video as it is developed.</p>
<p>Usually two video options are provided: a video without audio description, and a separate video with audio description.</p>
