_Captions are only one aspect of making audio and video accessible. For more, see [Making Video and Audio Accessible - Introduction](http://@@)._

## Introduction

_Who:_ Captions provide content to people who are Deaf and others who cannot hear the audio. They are also used by people who process written information better than audio.

<img src="{{ "/content-images/captions.png" | relative_url }}" alt="" style="float: right; margin-left: 2rem; clear:right; width: 30%; max-width: 220px">

_What:_ Captions are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content. They are displayed within the media player and are synchronized with the audio.

Most are "closed captions" that can be hidden or shown by people watching the video. They can be "open captions" that are always displayed and cannot be turned off.

### Related to Captions

Caption files are used by media players to provide _interactive transcripts_. Interactive transcripts highlight text phrases as they are spoken. Users can select text in the transcript and go to that point in the video. (Some players provide interactive transcript funcationality, and some do not.) <img src="{{ "/content-images/interactive-transcript.png" | relative_url }}" alt="">

_Subtitles_ are the spoken audio translated into another language. They are implemented like captions. Subtitles can be only the spoken audio (for people who can hear the audio) or can be a translation of the caption content including non-speech audio information.

### Notes

For optimum accessibility, provide a separate caption file of the audio description.

**Captions and transcripts include the same text, so one can be used to develop the other.**

### Scope

This page addresses developing captions for pre-recorded media. Live captions are usually done by professional Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) providers. Live captions are not addressed on this page.

## Captions Considerations

Creating captions requires typing up audio (&quot;transcribing&quot;) and formatting it in a file with timestamps. It is fairly difficult to transcribe an audio file, and takes quite a bit of time for people who don't have the software and skill for it. The file format for captions are simple, yet it's tedious to add timestamps, especially without software or service for developing caption files.

**Good captioning requires knowledge of which non-speech audio information should be included in the captions, and (@@Chris).**

Even correcting an automatic caption files takes quite a bit of time for people who don't do it regularly.

However, people who have the software, skills, and experience in developing captions, can develop them much faster.

For these reasons, many organizations choose to outsource their captions.

## Automatic Captions are Not Sufficient

Automatically-generated captions do not meet user needs or accessibility requirements, unless they are confirmed to be fully accurate. Usually they need significant editing. 

There are tools that use speech recognition technology to turn a soundtrack into a timed caption file. For example, many videos uploaded to YouTube have automatic captions. [[YouTube info](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3038280)] However, often the automatic caption text does not match the spoken audio — and in ways that change the meaning (or are embarrassing). For example, missing just one word such as "not" can make the captions contradict the actual audio content.

<p style="text-align:center; text-size:85%">[<em>optionally as an illustration for visual interest (with text as true text):</em><br>
  &quot;Spoken text: 
  Broil on high for 4 to 5 minutes. You should not preheat the oven.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Automatic caption: Broil on high for 45 minutes. You should know to preheat the oven.&quot;<br>
  <em>optional illustration/picture:  fire coming from oven, or totally burned food on a broiler pan ;-)</em>]</p>

Automatic captions can be used as a starting point for developing accurate captions and transcripts.

## Example Workflow

More information on these steps are in this web page.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" class="" %}
{:/}

1. Pick a caption tool.
2. Understand what to include in captions, including the Tips.
3. Write up the captions and timing in the tool.
4. Review your captions as the video plays, and edit as needed.
5. Export the caption file.
6. If your tool provides it, export a file to create the transcript.

## Caption Tools

Most people use software or services to help develop captions. There are several free captioning software programs and online services available.

<p style="text-align:center">[image of captioning software or service, probably YouTube since that's one many novies will use]</p>

Some tools create automatic captions that you can use as a starting point. You will need to edit automatic captions for accuracy.

For example, YouTube provides automatic captions and tools for you to edit the captions, as described in [Edit or remove captions – YouTube Help](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734705?hl=en).

## What to Included in Caption Files

Include in the captions file:
* All speech and other relevant non-speech sound, such as this-good-example.
* The time each phrase should be displayed.
* Speaker identification, for example, in interviews.

### Tips for Caption Content

{% include excol.html type="middle" %}

Keep in mind that the main purpose of the captions is to provide information to people who cannot hear the audio. That will help you know what to sounds to transcribe, and what are not needed. The following are common practices, not requirements.

#### Specific for captions

* Captions are one or two rows. ?? character length

* Put a new sentence on a new line.

* If you need to break a sentence into multiple segments, break it at a logical phrase.

#### For captions and transcripts

* Identify the speakers as relevant. Often it is best to use the full name the first time and single name throughout &mdash; either first/given or last/family depending on the formality.

* You can include relevant information about the speech. For example:<br>
	<em>( shouting ):</em><br>
	I hate this computer!

* Put important non-speech sounds in parentheses, lowercase, italics, with a space before and after. For example:<br>
	 <em>( computer crashing into bits and parts sliding across the floor )</em>

* When a speaker is off-screen, you can put their speech in italics. For example:<br>
	<em>Jose: What was that awful noise?</em><br>
	Zoe: You don't want to know.<br>
	<em>Jose: Well, I'm coming to find out.</em>

* Only include background music if it's important to understand the content of the video. Use objective descriptions that indicate the mood; avoid subjective words, such as "beautiful." If the words in the music are important, add a musical note to the beginning and end of each caption. Put music information in italics. For example:<br>
	<em>♪ scary music, JAWS theme ♪</em>

* Do not emphasize a word using all capital letters except to indicate screaming.

##### Be True to the Audio Content

* **Do not change or adapt or add to the text**. Transcribe what is said accurately.
   * For example, it is usually not appropriate to correct grammar or other mistakes.
   * Do not censor. For example, if objectionable words are said, include those in the captions. If the audio is edited to obscure a phrase (e.g., "bleeped" audio), reflect that in the captions, e.g., <em> --bleep-- </em>
   * Do not provide additional clarifying information in the captions. (You can provide some in the transcript as appropriate.)

* Level of detail:
   * For some content, such as legal depositions, transcribe everything verbatim, including things like "um", "ah", and repeated phrases.
   * For most web content, it is acceptable to leave out non-substantive text to make the captions easier to process &mdash; while adhering to the tips above. For example, if the speaker says:<br><em><strong>I just got so frustrated</strong> (cough, cough) sorry – uhhh what was I saying?..., oh yea - <strong>I got so frustrated with my computer.</strong></em><br>
You can caption:<br>
<em><strong>I just got so frustrated with my computer.</strong></em>
   * If there is speech that is not at all relevant, indicate that it has been excluded from the captions. For example:<br>
	<em>[participants discuss the weather while the presenter reboots his computer]</em>

* If you cannot understand what is said, transcribe:<br>
[unintelligible]

* [@@ Do not caption the same, or nearly the same, information that is already shown onscreen. https://dcmp.org/learn/225 ]

## Caption File Format

The most common format for captions on the web is [WebVTT](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt/): The Web Video Text Tracks Format.
