<p>Captions provide content to people who are Deaf and others who cannot hear the audio. They are also used by people who process written information better than audio.</p>
<p>Captions are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content. They are displayed within the media player and  are synchronized with the audio.</p>
<p>Most are "closed captions" that can be hidden or shown by people watching the video. They can  be "open captions" that are always displayed and cannot be turned off.</p>
<p><strong><em>Subtitles</em></strong> are the spoken audio translated into another language. They are implemented like captions. Subtitles can be only the spoken audio (for people who can hear the audio) or can be a translation of the caption content including non-speech audio information.</p>
