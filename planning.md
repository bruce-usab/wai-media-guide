This page helps you plan accessible media. It:
* helps you **figure out what your specific audio or video needs** (captions, audio description, a basic transcript, or a descriptive transcript)
* helps you plan what to develop in-house and what to outsource
* shows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards for audio and video media

## Informing Users When None Needed {#none}
{:.no_toc}

<p>If your video does not need captions (because there is no substantive audio content) or does not need audio description (because there is no substantive visual content), it's good to let users know that. Otherwise, they might think that you accidentally forgot to provide it. For example:</p>

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" class="" %}
{:/}

Captions not needed: The only sound with this video is background music. There is no speaking.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" class="" %}
{:/}

Audio description not needed: This video does not include audio description because the visuals only support what is spoken; the visuals do not provide additional information.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

## Both Captions and a Transcript

Ideally you provide captions and a separate transcript.

For audio-only, captions enable people who are hard of hearing to get the richness of listening to the audio and fill in what they don't hear well by reading the captions.

For videos, captions enable people who are Deaf or hard of hearing to see the visual content and read the captions at the same time. 

Transcripts are required to provide access to people who are Deaf-blind and use braille. (Also, transcripts have several [additional benefits](/design-develop/media/#additional-benefits) to all users.)

## Planning Accessible Audio and Video

<img src="{{ "/content-images/wai-media-guide/in-or-out.png" | relative_url }}" alt="" style="float: right; margin-left: 2rem; clear:right; width: 30%; max-width: 220px">

Include specific accessibility requirements in your:
* Project requirements - internal and external
* Requests for Proposal (RFP) or Requests for Tender (RFT)
* Contracts

Here is an example workflow for developing an accessible video, with notes on who develops the material:

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Workflow and Responsibilities" class="" %}
{:/}

1. Address accessibility in **[video content](/design-develop/media/av-content/)** as the video is planned and produced.<br>_By:_ Script writers, videographers, producers, and others.

2. Develop an **[audio described version](/design-develop/media/description/)** of the video at the same time as the main video, if needed.<br>_By:_ The same people doing the main video also do the describe version.

3. Develop **[captions](/design-develop/media/captions/)** for the main video, for the audio described version, and of the audio description itself.<br>_By:_ Usually if the video is professionally produced, the producers provide captions. Sometimes when informal videos are developed in-house, captions are outsourced.

4. Develop a **[descriptive transcript](/design-develop/media/transcripts/)** using the text from the caption files.<br>_By:_ Often transcripts are developed in-house from caption files.

5. Implement it in an **[accesible media player](/design-develop/media/player/)** (usually an existing player with good accessibility support).<br>_By:_ Usually in-house web developers.

To help you plan in-house and outsourced work, the sub-pages of this resource include **considerations, skills, and tools needed** for creating accessible media:
* [Audio Description Considerations](/design-develop/media/description/#audio-description-considerations)
* [Captions, Skills and Tools](/design-develop/media/captions/#skills-and-tools) and [Automatic Captions are Not Sufficient](/design-develop/media/captions/#automatic-captions-are-not-sufficient)
* [Transcripts, Skills and Tools](/design-develop/media/transcripts/#skills-and-tools)
* [Media Palyers, Skills and Tools](/design-develop/media/player/#skills-and-tools)

When planning for accessible media, it maybe helpful to communicate the **[additional benefits](/design-develop/media/#additional-benefits) to all users** and to your organization, such as search engine optimization (SEO).

## Standards

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is introduced in the [WCAG Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" class="" %}
{:/}

This resource uses most WCAG terminology, with a few differences:
* "time-based media" in WCAG = "audio and video media" in this resource
* "[alternative for time based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG#alt-time-based-mediadef)" in WCAG = "transcript" for audio-only and "descriptive transcript" for video in this resource

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

WCAG includes requirements for audio and video media at [Level](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance.html#uc-levels-head) A, AA, and AAA. Most media is required by governing policies to meet Level AA &mdash; which includes both A and AA listed in the tables below.

Accessibility requirements for video and audio are different based on if they are:
* pre-recorded or live
* video with audio, video without audio (video only), or audio only

### More about Standards

To learn more about WCAG standards for media, see [Understanding Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/time-based-media).

Other WCAG requirements related to audio and video include:
* Requirements for content covered in this resource: [Accessible Audio and Video Content](/design-develop/media/av-content/)
* [2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html) (Level A) For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:...
* [1.4.2 Audio Control](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-dis-audio.html) (Level A) If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume...

### Descriptive Transcripts

<p>Although WCAG Level AA does not require descriptive transcripts for videos, we recommend them because they:</p>
<ul>
  <li>are needed for most videos to be accessible to people who are &quot;Deaf-blind&quot;</li>
  <li>meet a wide range of accessibility needs</li>
  <li>provide <a href="/design-develop/media/#additional-benefits">additional benefits</a> for users <em>without</em> disabilities, and for your organization (for example, <abbr title="search engine optimization"> SEO</abbr>)</li>
  <li><strong>are easy and inexpensive to develop</strong> using captions and audio description that you already have to meet Level AA</li>
</ul>
