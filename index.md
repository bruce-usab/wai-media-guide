## Understanding User Experiences

It's easy to understand that a person who is Deaf can't hear the audio, so you need to provide important audio information in another form. Here are some other considerations to help you understand the user experience behind making audio and video accessible. _(Descriptions of each aspect is below on this page.)_
* Many people who are **Deaf** can read text well, and use _transcripts_ or _captions_. Some cannot, and prefer _sign language_.
* Many people who are **hard of hearing** like to listen to the audio to hear what they can, and have _captions_ to fill in what they can't hear adequately.
* Some people who have **difficulty processing auditory information** also use _captions_. Many need _transcripts_ so they can read at their own pace.
* People who are **blind** need to know the relevant visual information in a video.  _Audio description of visual information_ can be provided separate from the main video.
* People who are **Deaf-blind** need the audio information and the visual information in text so they can read it with Braille. They need _descriptive transcripts_.
* Some people **cannot focus and comprehend auditory or visual information** when there is changing visuals. For most videos, they also need _descriptive transcripts_.

Captions are a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content. _Subtitles_ are the spoken audio translated into another language. Captions and subtitles are synchronized with the audio and usually shown in a media player. </td>

## Example

An example accessible video is [Video Captions](/perspective-videos/captions/). That page provides:
* video and audio content with accessibility considerations, such as low background audio
* an audio described version of the video
* captions
* a descriptive transcript
* a media player with accessibility support, including an interactive transcript

## Additional Benefits

Accessible video and audio is **essential for people with disabilities**, and is **useful for everyone** in a variety of situations.

For example, transcripts can be:
* Skimmed or read rather than watched or listened to. This is significantly easier and quicker for many users. Sometimes people want to skim the transcript first before deciding whether or not to play the media.
* Used without needing to download video files. For example, to save data on mobile.
* Used offline, printed, or converted to Braille.
* Better indexed by search engines.

And captions can be:
* Used in loud environments where users cannot hear the audio. For example, a bar, an airport, and [@@ another good example].
* Used in quiet environments where users cannot turn on sound. For example, a library, when others are sleeping, and and [@@ another good example].
* Used by people who cannot understand the spoken language well and can understand the written language better. For example, people who are not native speakers of the language.
* Used by people to help them learn to read. For example, children, adults, and people learning a new language.
* Used to better understand content since users can hear the information in audio and see it in text at the same time. For example, {@@some data like [this](https://www.3playmedia.com/2019/02/21/8-benefits-of-transcribing-captioning-videos/)}.
