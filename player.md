## Support for Separate Audio Files

Some players support multiple audio files, so you can provide a file for the main audio and a separate file for the audio description of visual information.

These players, platforms, and plug-ins support multiple audio files:
* 3Play Plugin
* Brightcove
* JW Player, with plug-in (works in IE11 & Safari, other browsers require Flash)
* Kaltura, with plug-in
* Oz Player
* VideoJS, with Plug-in (works in IE11 & Safari, other browsers require Flash)
* ?Vidyard

Able Player facilitates showing a separate video with audio description.
