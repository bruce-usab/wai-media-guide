Sign languages use hand and arm movements, facial expressions, and body positions to convey meaning.

For most people who are Deaf, sign language is their native language, and some do not read or understand written language well.

Note that there are different sign languages in different regions and countries; for example, American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and Auslan (Australian Sign Language) are all different.

Sign language is not required to meet most minimum accessibility standards.
